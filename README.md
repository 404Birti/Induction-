  >>Today’s lecture wasn’t just informative — it was an experience.
From science to spirituality, jokes to jaw-drops, it had everything packed in one unforgettable session.

   >Sir explained GOD as Generator, Operator, Destroyer — simple yet powerful.

  >Broke down the significance of the number 108, linking it with divinity.

   >Gave a wild take on 206 bones, linking them to mythological figures:
26 feet, 27 hands, 28 heads, 52 bodies, 10 arms, 10 legs.

  >Jokingly called two boys "God and his wife" — yes, in front of the whole class 😭.

   >Demonstrated an ignition experiment using a spray bottle — it actually launched.

  >Took the same fuel, applied it to his forehead, and lit a bulb using his body. Insane.

   > Said “If you ever meet God, I’ll help you talk to Him” — and wrote Bhagwan on the board.

  > Balanced deep concepts with humour — he was laughing with us while telling us not to laugh.

   > Was honoured by a trustee right after the lecture — well-earned moment.
