> Honestly, the first time I felt like maybe money and maths could actually be interesting — and doable.

---

## DAY TWO – Tests, Myths & GitHub Realities

**Proficiency Tests**  
English and Maths assessments held in the first half.

> Tests were fine. More like a reminder:  
> College won’t let you cruise — but it won’t drown you either.

---

**Food Sciences Lecture – Dr. Arashdeep Singh (PAU)**

> Busted food myths with science — and a dash of humour.

- Kurkure is made from rice and pulses, not plastic.
- Bread is fermented — easier to digest for those with weak digestion.
- If allergic to wheat, avoid gluten grains: wheat, barley, oats.
- Emphasized understanding food as chemistry + tradition — not just trend.

> Surprisingly engaging. Made me rethink food as more than just taste or health — but also as science and culture.

---

**GitHub Orientation – Causmic Club Seniors**

> “Start now — your GitHub profile is your tech resume.”

- Walkthrough on creating GitHub accounts.
- Overview of induction project submissions via GitHub.
- Encouragement to start building a digital portfolio early.

> For once, felt like I had a digital identity to build — not just another social media account.

---

## DAY THREE – Mind-Bending to Mind-Clearing

**Expert Lecture – Sir Jaswinder Singh**

> From science to spirituality — this lecture had its own fanbase by the end.

- Introduced GOD as: Generator, Operator, Destroyer.
- Explained divine pattern of 108 across traditions.
- Connected 206 bones to mythology:
  - 26 feet, 27 hands, 28 heads, 52 bodies, 10 arms, 10 legs (symbolic representation).
- Called two students “God and His wife” 😭 (crowd-favorite moment).
- Spray bottle ignition experiment — launched on stage.
- Lit a bulb using his body (yes, after applying fuel to his forehead).
- Wrote “Bhagwan” on the board and said:  
  > “I told you I’d make you meet God.”  
  Couldn’t even argue with it — and he explained it logically too. Hats off.
- Received honour from a trustee post-lecture - S. Gurcharan Singh Garewal — well-deserved.

> Honestly? He was electric. Left the hall with more questions, but also this weird clarity. Like curiosity could be holy too.

---

**Universal Human Values & Wellness Lecture – Priya Darshani Ma’am**

> A calm pause — reflecting on life beyond academics.

- Differentiated physical needs vs. facilities.
- Discussed right understanding, relationships, and emotional balance.
- Emphasized: “Happiness is a state of mind — not a destination.”

> Bit dry, but necessary. Like eating salad when you’d rather have fries — still part of the balance.

---

**Doubt-Clearing Session – HOD, Applied Sciences**

- Took open questions from students — including ones she asked herself (to make us feel safe asking).
- Cleared confusion around curriculum, tools, clubs, and general expectations.

> Left lighter. Some anxiety shed.  
> Questions became a little less scary.

## DAY FOUR – P2P Learning & Programming Foundations

**P2P Explanation**
- **Compiler**: Converts human-readable code to machine-readable format.  
- **Algorithm**: Step-by-step procedure to solve a particular problem.  
- **Pseudocode**: Code written in plain English — simpler to understand.  
- **Flowchart**: Visual representation of logic using diagrammatic symbols.  

**Algorithm Example**  
> Start  
> Input two variables `x`, `y`  
> Add `x` and `y`, store in `sum`  
> Display `sum`  
> End  

**Pseudocode:**  
> Start  
> Input A, B  
> Set sum = A + B  
> Display sum  
> End  

**Flowchart** (described in text form):  
[Start] → [Input A, B] → [Sum = A + B] → [Display Sum] → [End]  

---

**C++ Basics**  
> "Programming is like talking to a very stubborn robot — say exactly what you mean."

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   int age;
   cout << "Enter your age: ";
   cin >> age;
   cout << "Your age is " << age;
   return 0;
}
```

**Key Concepts**:

- `#include <iostream>` → Preprocessor directive  
- `using namespace std;` → Removes the need for `std::` before keywords like `cout`  
- `int main()` → Starting point of a C++ program  
- `cout <<` → Insertion operator (outputs to screen)  
- `cin >>` → Extraction operator (takes input from user)  

**Data Types**:
- `int`: Integers  
- `float`: Decimal numbers (e.g., 8.96)  
- `char`: Single characters (`'a'`, `'A'`)  
- `bool`: Boolean (`true/false`)  
- `string`: Collection of characters (e.g., `"Hello"`)  

**Variable Naming Rules**:
- Must start with a letter or underscore `_`  
- No spaces or special symbols (except `_`)  
- Avoid reserved keywords like `int`, `cout`  
- Cannot start with a number, though it may end with one

**English Lecture – Class Introductions**

Each student introduced themselves with: their name, school , hobbies , strengths , weeknesses , achievements , accomplishments and a few other things

> Felt like a soft launch — everyone’s story packed into 2 minutes. Surprisingly humanizing.

## 5th August

### BEEE (Basics of Electrical & Electronics Engineering)
The day began with an introduction to BEEE — no heavy circuits yet, just a walkthrough of what the subject holds and how it's going to unfold over the semester. It felt more like a teaser trailer than the movie, but it did the job.

>  Introductions (again)
Another round — this time just our **names, a hobby**, and **board marks**. Faster, less pressure, and less overthinking... thankfully.

### Chemistry Orientation
The chemistry faculty gave us an overview of what the subject would look like — how it's split across different streams, how internal/external marks are divided, and a basic sense of where it fits in. Honestly, it wasn’t hardcore studying, but it still managed to hold attention. 

### Break (12:30 PM – 2:00 PM)
We used the break to wander a bit — campus exploration continues. This time we checked out the **sports complex**. Didn’t find the badminton courts (a little disappointing), but billiards made up for it in the most unexpected way. Smooth, quiet, focused — kinda liked it. There's still so much campus left to see, but we're getting there.

### ID Card Photos
2 PM was for photos. It went smoother than expected. Not sure if it captured me right — either ways....its done

---

> Not an intense day academically, but it had its own rhythm. Slowly settling into the space... and maybe even starting to find pieces of myself in it. Just not all of them yet.
